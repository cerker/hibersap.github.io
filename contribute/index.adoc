==== Fork the repository

If you want to contribute to the Hibersap project, the first thing to do is to fork the original GitHub repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the fork button in the link:https://github.com/hibersap/hibersap[Hibersap repository]:

==== Clone the forked repository

The forked repository is now part of your GitHub account's list of repositories. Clone the GitHub repository by executing the following command on your command line:

----
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/hibersap.git
----


==== Add original repository as remote

Your local repository has your fork on GitHub as a default remote repository (named origin). To be able to pull your changes to the original project repository at a later stage, you need to locally add the latter as an additional remote repository (named upstream):

----
$ cd hibersap
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/hibersap/hibersap.git
$ git fetch upstream
----

The fetch command updates your fork with any changes that happened to the original repository in the meantime.


==== Create a branch

Create a topic branch for your new feature.

----
$ git checkout -b my_new_feature
----


==== Develop

Here comes the cool part: Develop your new feature. Write tests. Add and commit changes to your local branch:

----
$ git add ...
$ git commit ...
----


==== Push the branch

When you are finished, make sure there are no build errors and all the tests pass. Then, push your branch to your GitHub repository:

----
$ git push origin my_new_feature
----


==== Send pull request

In your web browser, navigate to your GitHub repository and switch to the branch containing your changes (here: my_new_feature).
Press the Pull Request button and provide a title and comment. Check the Commits and Files Changed tabs to see if everything is right.
Finally, press the Send Pull Request button and you are finished.

=== Submit documentation

You are also welcome to contribute to the Hibersap documentation.
To submit a pull request, please follow the steps above with a different GitHub repository:
link:https://github.com/hibersap/hibersap.github.io[].
The repository contains the web site including the Hibersap Reference Guide.

The web site is built using link:http://awestruct.org[Awestruct] which itself builds on the Ruby programming language.
Most of the pages are in AsciiDoc format.
link:http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoc] is used to process the AsciiDoc files inside Awestruct.
As a CSS framework link:http://foundation.zurb.com/[Zurb Foundation] is used.

Changes must only be made to the `develop` branch!
The master branch contains the web site after the build.

==== Build the web site

To build the Hibersap web site you need to have Ruby installed. You also need to install the following Ruby gems:

----
$ gem install awestruct coffee-script htmlcompressor uglifier slim
----

To build the site run the following command from the command line:

----
$ rake
----

The default task that will be run by the rake build is `preview`.
This starts up a web server with the site and you can open it in the browser with the following URL:
link:http://localhost:4242/[]

To run the build and start a web server for development purposes:

----
$ rake preview
----

To run clean up and run the preview :

----
$ rake clean preview
----

To just run the build without starting a web server:

----
$ rake gen
----

Deploy to GitHub pages:

----
$ rake deploy
----
